        title: 'Introduction to Professional Skills',
        summary: [
            'If you read the introduction, the insight regarding the term \'Professional skills\' had emerged that expressed how important is it to have clarity regarding this domain. To further exploration, the very first lecture was conducted by Miss Ishara Raviharee Weerasinghe encompassing almost all the aspects of professional skills.',
            'The other terms for professional skills are soft skills or employability skills demonstrating the same meaning of non-technical, interpersonal abilities that are essential for success in the workplace. The technical skills would restrict their abilities to a particular sector but professional skills are not like that. They are transferable meaning that they can be applied across various roles and industries. For general examples, teamwork, problem-solving, adaptability, leadership and communication can be considered as employability skills. Indeed, workplace skills are divided into three classifications. They are technical skills, soft skills, and transferable skills.',
            'The next topic is about the descriptions of values, beliefs, attitudes, and character. There are multiple circumstances in our lives where we need to make decisions regarding critical situations, making decisions on them and considering whether they are right or wrong. In the real world, this can be very hard to achieve as we are getting matured. This is where values come in as principles and beliefs that guide us to come across these circumstances to make the right and effective decisions. Examples of values are honesty, integrity, respect, responsibility, compassion, excellence, fairness, and courage. Beliefs are simply about personal assumptions and convictions that shape how we perceive the world and ourselves. They can differ based on personal experiences, cultural backgrounds, and upbringing. Examples are self-efficacy, growth mindset, optimism, locus of control, prejudices, self-worth, and fatalism. Attitudes, on the other hand, govern our susceptibility to respond to specific people, situations, or ideas positively or negatively. They also can differ respectively in experiences, beliefs, and values and are vital when we interact with others especially other than the family. Examples are positive attitude, open-mindedness, tolerance, prejudice, confidence, cynicism, and empathy. Next, the description is about the character. A character can be described as an aligning of one\'s actions with the above descriptions of values, beliefs, and attitudes. Most of the vital characteristics that aid in determining a character are trustworthiness, respectfulness, responsibility, caring, citizenship, fairness, and courage.',
            'To aid in applications for these theoretical facts, there were a few activities and quizzes done on behalf of us which will be discussed in the latter part of this chapter with pictures.'

        self_reflection: [
            'This didactic lesson inspired me in different ways giving me insights into aspects that were unknown in employment and industries. I have come across various kinds of challenges in technical-related activities without even having clarity regarding soft skills even though I had applied them in those scenarios. I wish I had this module before my degree program began then I would have done better than this.',
            'Considering theoretical aspects, the most applicable characteristic for me was the growth mindset which was discussed under examples of beliefs. It described how we should embrace challenges and view failures as opportunities for learning and growth. Before my degree program began, in the foundation program, I had a critical challenge in communication skills and writing in English. The technical aspects were not a big deal for me but communication skills exactly were. I embraced this challenge and explored my weaknesses to overcome and sharpen my abilities. I did and practiced many assignments and worksheets in an enthusiastic way that a regular student would never do. I even contributed to IELTS and other free online activities on different platforms for this growth. Finally, after my degree program, I could get the best results in my badge and it has been consistent up to where I am now. Once this module was taught, I realized how a growth mindset would make a man persistent regardless of the individual\'s sector.',
            'Overall, I find this lesson a tremendous help to enhance my employability skills as I step into the real industry in next semester, and would really appreciate for giving us better insights and opportunities to enhance our soft skills throughout this module.'

        summary: [
            'Today\'s topic was to learn how to properly craft a curriculum vitae. A common mistake that students make when sending their CVs for jobs is not tailoring their CV respectively. Tailoring a CV means the student should craft a CV relevant to the specific jobs that they are applying for. It showcases the most relevant qualifications and experiences. Tailoring helps to let recruiters know that we have researched their company and identified their needs. Researching the company and job description to identify keywords and requirements is important. Including these keywords and skills that match the requirements would increase the chance of passing through an automated applicant tracking system (ATS). Finally, we learned about the major sections that should be included in our CVs. The essential components for a CV are personal information, professional summary, work experience, education, skills, and achievements and awards.',
            'Another major fact when sending a CV is to write a cover letter that introduces the CV. It is an extension of the CV and reflects our knowledge regarding the employers’ needs. Therefore, the post activity included an activity related to cover letter writing. The lecturer was also able to conduct a review and feedback session to provide instructions on already created CVs.'

            'The CV is considered to be the document that makes a positive first impression on employers giving both ATS and employers possibilities to ask for interviews ahead. My CV prior to this session included contents that were not relevant to the job I was applying for therefore I realized what are the weak points in those contents and how to mitigate them by replacing the didactic factors in that CV. However, I was able to recreate my CV that meets the requirements of a proper CV and was able to get feedback on it.'

            'As the previous chapter demonstrated how to properly craft a CV, the next thing that we need to consider is how to face an interview. Once the employer is satisfied with the CV, one of the representatives of their organization would reach out to us for a time or set of interviews to recruit us. Once they do, we should be prepared to face the interview with proper skills.',
            'A job interview is a pre-determined conversation between an applicant and middle-level or top-level management with the mind of recruiting the interviewee. They look for skills, competencies, knowledge, and especially experiences to find out whether we are the best match for their work. The other way around, we also need to ensure the company culture, environment, terms and conditions, and workplace are matching to our expectations to have the position there. ',
            'The best interview strategy is to prepare ourselves by answering the questions, what we want the interviewer to know about ourselves, what disadvantages or weaknesses we want to minimize, and what we need to know about the job or the organization to which we are applying. Communication skills play a major role in facing an interview. If they are extended further, they can be expressed as non-verbal communication which possesses a great impact on the interview, listening, responding, and questioning. Despite we think that words communicated by us have more effect, considerable percentages are distributed among our tone of voice and body language which are considered as non-verbal communication. Questioning is also one of the major things we need to be aware of because it demonstrates our attitude and enthusiasm towards the job and company. In some times, interviewees tend to give vague answers to technical or non-technical questions. The reason is a lack of listening. We have to always listen before answering and listening would also increase the quality of our relationships with others. The tips include paying attention, showing that we are listening, seeking clarification if we do not understand, deterring judgment, and responding appropriately. Talking in which, there are 6 C\'s of effective communication. They are clear, concise, correct, complete, concrete, courteous and confident. When describing ourselves, the aspects are describing our personality, strengths, education, work experiences, and future goals with proper language and non-verbal communication.',
            'The interview structure includes an introduction, evidence speaking, questions, and closure. When answering, stick with the STAR structure meaning that we should express the situation, target, actions, and results. In the latter part of this session discussed the attire in detail and gave closure with post activities.'

            'Before this session. I had faced two job interviews and got one internship in a leading company situated in Colombo. However, I find this lesson a comprehensive guide on interview skills but it seems to me that the entire domain is somewhat overwhelming and needs to consider only the relevant skills and styles which are best for us. In addition, what I did not get from this lesson is the clarity about online interviews and how we handle a situation where we need to demonstrate the same set of skills accordingly. The reason is that most of the interviews in our industry are conducted online and the way how express the above factors might be a little bit changed with online interviews.',
            'Overall, the interview skills we learned from this lesson were tremendous, leaving us as undergraduates who have great potential in industry and even knowing the best skills for employment and interaction. Considering other universities, the students may lack interview skills therefore allowing us to have a module like this would help us achieve the most popular saying to “harness the adrenaline to work for you so that you put your best foot forward and get the job you want”.

It may have been created with the mind of employment or just to showcase individuals\' abilities. However, this session delved into all the aspects in which portfolios can supplement their meaning. If listed, they are job applications, career advancement, creative industries, educational assessments, teaching education, freelancing and consulting, and so on. The first main topic was to discuss the personal portfolio.',

The company in here is not meant to be related to financial aspects. It can be related to education, family, academic, organizational, and so on. Despite the domain, to achieve this general objective, we can have a meeting.',

Taking a general phrase that can have in meetings into consideration, the combinations can be expressed as “Organize a meeting”, “arrange”, “postpone”, “cancel” “set up”, “make”, “bring forward”, “put back”, and so on but these should be applied according to the scenario. The vital fact resides in which type of meeting we conduct. The types of meetings are chat, brainstorming, project meeting/team meeting, department/departmental meeting, meeting with suppliers, meeting with customers, board meeting, annual general meeting/AGM, and EGM (extraordinary general meeting). An activity related to this was done and it has been attached to the material sections. The next topic in this chapter was regarding how to plan a meeting. Planning a meeting is not complex. Everyone in this world can do that. It involves pre-consideration such as the date on which the meeting is going to be conducted, location, participants, objectives, equipment, facilities, papers, timing, and so on. There are a few meeting preparation checklists and those have also been shown in the material section.',

Dos include obeying the ground rules, being positive, separating people from problems, keeping to the topic being discussed, using clear simple language, allowing others to finish, and so on. Don\'ts include facts such as monopolizing the discussion, becoming emotional, or too argumentative, making personal criticisms, digressing, using long complicated sentences, and so on. All in all, the key facts include listening actively, observing others, being diplomatic, and being positive and we must ensure these facts are preserved as individual considerations when we are in a meeting.

The most favorite part of this lesson in my opinion occurred when we discussed the dos and don\'ts in meetings. The most common issue in any meeting is taking problems personally and getting a sophisticated emotional state or highly argumentative which must not be done during a meeting. I have come across this situation so many times. Therefore, I personally liked the phrases, “separate people from problems” and “not to be emotional or too argumentative”. Even though I experienced them, splitting out in front of the lecture with our group members was enticing to let us know how important these facts are. Lots of people tend to wander off the subject when they find that the meeting is boring. This lesson taught us what actions we have to take as people in charge of the meetings to keep the meeting alive.',

        summary: [
            'This lesson happened to be very short since we already learned them in the foundation program. However, this chapter points out a few major factors regarding email etiquette rather than discussing the theory and structures of writing emails. Email etiquettes are simply the domain-specific rules that we use when writing emails. We should ensure a professional tone and proofread each email before we send them. These rules need not be comprehensively applied to informal emails but they should be preserved when writing formal emails based on the purpose that we are writing.',
            'This paragraph aims to provide a brief set of rules that need to be followed when writing an email. When writing subjects, use logical keywords so that the recipient can easily search for our email. It is better to use our name when applying for a job. Do not use greetings in formal emails such as “hello” or “greetings”. A clear introduction about what are we going to say must be written afterward. It should give exclusive clarity regarding the content of the message. After writing the content add a proper closing (Best, kind regards, regards, sincerely, yours truly, and so on). It is a must to write the email in the correct tone. A few sample tones have been attached in this chapter.',
            'Before hitting send, we have to make sure of the correctness of the spells, subject line, and appropriate greetings and closing, if responding to a message, we should ensure we have answered it properly, and so on. After we hit send we should have patience because emails are not for time-critical situations. However, if we do not receive a reply, we may need to send a follow-up email because the recipient may be working through a busy inbox.',
            'These are the basic etiquette that needs to be followed when writing professional emails. To follow up, a material to guide in this aspect has been also attached.'

        self_reflection: [
            'The things learned in this lecture were already known by myself from the foundation program by the same lecturer so the lesson also got quick to finish. However, as I indicated, some of the email etiquettes were important such as variations of tones. The sample document indeed helped me to learn about different styles and tones that I can use when writing professional emails. We had post activities for writing emails. I went through them (but not for all within my limited time frame) and have indicated them in the material section.'

        title: 'Research design and writing abstract',
        summary: [
            'This lesson encompasses research design and writing abstracts as a part of the lecture series. Research design is a blueprint used to complete a study and it ensures that the study is relevant to the problem and would use economical procedures.',
            'The components of a research design include population, sample, time frame, data collection methods, data collection tools, and data analysis. These researchers can get approaches of quantitative or qualitative based on the cases in which we initiate the research. The major difference between these two approaches can be stated in the type of data collected. Directly measurable data like numerical data are used in quantitative research while recordable data are used in qualitative research. The main types of qualitative research are case studies, phenomenology, and ethnography. The data collection methods to use in that approach are observations, interviews, questionnaires, and journal entries. The data collection methods for quantitative research are surveys, questionnaires, and experiments. As researchers, we can have combinations of these two approaches to make the research more factual.', 
            'Next up, the lesson got rapid. It was about sampling methods. I am not going to discuss them in this chapter because we mastered them in a module called probability and statistics in the previous semester. There we did an actual quantitative research as a partial fulfillment.',
            'At last, we learned how to write abstracts for research papers. The abstract is the section we often write after the rest of the report is written after making concise the whole demonstration together. However, this is the first thing people read when they need a quick overview of the paper. Therefore, we need to first read the entire research paper and gain clarity regarding each condensed section before writing the abstract. The main parts of abstraction include introduction, purpose, method, result, and conclusion. The abstract should be concise. A post-activity was also conducted by the lecturer that needed to be uploaded within a specific period on writing an abstract to a brief article.'
        ],
        self_reflection: [
            'I was familiar with research designs and different sampling methods since we did them all previously in the previous semester but it was interesting when learning how to write abstractions properly. A major fact I learned from this lesson is that the main difference between an executive summary and an abstract is that recommendations are provided in an executive summary while an abstract does not. However, I did write recommendations in my abstraction in an individual project. So that now, I know how to write it correctly. Writing an abstract is one of the critical things that we have to include in a research article because that\'s the one everyone is looking for in the initial steps of reading. Even though the post-activity mentioned each section that should be included in the abstraction, it was indeed helpful to write it correctly in a proper manner with the facts learned in that lecture.'

        title: 'Proposal writing',
        summary: [
            'As we are undergraduates in software engineering, we are preparing to offer ourselves to the industry that works with many types of projects in their regular workflow. They are not simulating the projects, they are actually applying their solutions to the sophisticated problems encountered when their project was not with their client in production. A project is a task or schema that requires a large amount of time, effort, and planning to complete. Before doing a project, one (usually the project manager) has to first make a project proposal. The clients may only give 5 to 10 minutes to read the project proposal therefore that document needs to be written in a manner that it lets the client or the reader accept the idea included in the project proposal in the best possible way.',
            'There are two types of proposals. External proposal and internal proposal. The external proposal has three components. They are the executive summary, management section, and financial section. The executive summary is the place where we convince the executives that their company should get the contract. Ego, there should be a concise version of technical, managerial, and financial sections. The management section includes the capability in which we can implement the project. This includes the person’s experiences as well as their success with previous projects and so on. This also includes the proposed schedule of implementation. The financial section simply gives details about the breakdown of costs for every item in the proposal.',
            'The internal proposal helps to gain acceptance from the internal staff in the organization. An internal proposal requires planning the proposal and then writing the proposal. First, try to identify the problem statement, and the respective solutions to overcome it. Figure out whether is it possible to implement the solution with the expected resources and always think about the meaning of the solution. It is better to think outside the domain to understand the meaning of the solution though it is our own solution to see whether this solution is indeed needed. The introduction is a crucial component of this document. It should include the purpose, credibility, definition of the problem, background of the problem, significance of the problem, solution, and preview of parts or sections of the proposal. There should be a discussion. The discussion should include enough content to persuade readers or clients to accept the proposal. The three areas need to be covered to convince the reader. They are the problem, the solution, and the context.',
            'In summary, we find the importance of a project proposal and the process of writing it in a way that helps to gain acceptance from the reader in the best possible way. Next, we learned about how to write a project evaluation report for our food festival. I do not demonstrate the contents of the food festival in this chapter. That will be included in an additional chapter apart from the main ten chapters. I cannot wait to say what happened in the food festival!'

        ],
        self_reflection: [
            'I find project proposal writing as one of the crucial initial steps that a project manager should consider. In our project proposal in the main module Project and Professional Aspects of IT (PPA), we wrote it in a solid way knowing that the project was going to be accepted since the client is very close to us. However, I indeed learned how hard is it to get acceptance from clients in the real world and the extra readings gave me insights to write a proper project proposal that entices customers/readers/clients to accept what we are offering. The reader may maintain an uninterruptable workflow without knowing its potential to increase the efficiency of the As-Is system. Ergo it is the responsibility of the writer of the project proposal to indicate the problem statement and the respective solution with funds needed to implement the solution. Then the reader realizes the benefits that they can gain if our solution is up and running in their environment. So, these insights came into my mind only because of the study I did after this lecture therefore I find this lecture as one of the best in the lecture series. Do not forget to read the next chapter, because it contains the best memories I collected from this semester.'
