        title: 'Introduction to Professional Skills',
        summary: [
            'If you read the introduction, the insight regarding the term \'Professional skills\' had emerged that expressed how important is it to have clarity regarding this domain. To further exploration, the very first lecture was conducted by Miss Ishara Raviharee Weerasinghe encompassing almost all the aspects of professional skills.',
            'The other terms for professional skills are soft skills or employability skills demonstrating the same meaning of non-technical, interpersonal abilities that are essential for success in the workplace. The technical skills would restrict their abilities to a particular sector but professional skills are not like that. They are transferable meaning that they can be applied across various roles and industries. For general examples, teamwork, problem-solving, adaptability, leadership and communication can be considered as employability skills. Indeed, workplace skills are divided into three classifications. They are technical skills, soft skills, and transferable skills.',
            'The next topic is about the descriptions of values, beliefs, attitudes, and character. There are multiple circumstances in our lives where we need to make decisions regarding critical situations, making decisions on them and considering whether they are right or wrong. In the real world, this can be very hard to achieve as we are getting matured. This is where values come in as principles and beliefs that guide us to come across these circumstances to make the right and effective decisions. Examples of values are honesty, integrity, respect, responsibility, compassion, excellence, fairness, and courage. Beliefs are simply about personal assumptions and convictions that shape how we perceive the world and ourselves. They can differ based on personal experiences, cultural backgrounds, and upbringing. Examples are self-efficacy, growth mindset, optimism, locus of control, prejudices, self-worth, and fatalism. Attitudes, on the other hand, govern our susceptibility to respond to specific people, situations, or ideas positively or negatively. They also can differ respectively in experiences, beliefs, and values and are vital when we interact with others especially other than the family. Examples are positive attitude, open-mindedness, tolerance, prejudice, confidence, cynicism, and empathy. Next, the description is about the character. A character can be described as an aligning of one\'s actions with the above descriptions of values, beliefs, and attitudes. Most of the vital characteristics that aid in determining a character are trustworthiness, respectfulness, responsibility, caring, citizenship, fairness, and courage.',
            'To aid in applications for these theoretical facts, there were a few activities and quizzes done on behalf of us which will be discussed in the latter part of this chapter with pictures.'

            'This didactic lesson inspired me in different ways giving me insights into aspects that were unknown in employment and industries. I have come across various kinds of challenges in technical-related activities without even having clarity regarding soft skills even though I had applied them in those scenarios. I wish I had this module before my degree program began then I would have done better than this.',
            'Considering theoretical aspects, the most applicable characteristic for me was the growth mindset which was discussed under examples of beliefs. It described how we should embrace challenges and view failures as opportunities for learning and growth. Before my degree program began, in the foundation program, I had a critical challenge in communication skills and writing in English. The technical aspects were not a big deal for me but communication skills exactly were. I embraced this challenge and explored my weaknesses to overcome and sharpen my abilities. I did and practiced many assignments and worksheets in an enthusiastic way that a regular student would never do. I even contributed to IELTS and other free online activities on different platforms for this growth. Finally, after my degree program, I could get the best results in my badge and it has been consistent up to where I am now. Once this module was taught, I realized how a growth mindset would make a man persistent regardless of the individual\'s sector.',
            'Overall, I find this lesson a tremendous help to enhance my employability skills as I step into the real industry in next semester, and would really appreciate for giving us better insights and opportunities to enhance our soft skills throughout this module.'
